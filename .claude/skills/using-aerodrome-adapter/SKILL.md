## When to use

Use this skill when you are:
- Discovering Aerodrome pools/gauges and estimating incentives
- Working with veAERO locks and weekly voting (fees/bribes/rebases)
- Minting/staking Slipstream CL positions or analyzing CL ranges
- Building strategies that route through Aerodrome swaps/liquidity
