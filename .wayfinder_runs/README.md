# Local Runs (not committed)

This directory is for **one-off scripts** created during interactive sessions (e.g. Claude Code "execution mode").

- Everything under `.wayfinder_runs/` is gitignored except this README.
- Prefer running scripts via the MCP tool `mcp__wayfinder__run_script` so Claude Code can show a review prompt.
- Override the directory via `WAYFINDER_RUNS_DIR` (defaults to `.wayfinder_runs`).
