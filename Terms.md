**Terms of Service**

BEFORE ACCESSING THE INTERFACE OR USING ANY SDK OR API OR ANY SERVICES YOU MUST READ  

The Terms of Service (the "**Terms**") carefully because they govern your use of the website located at <https://wayfinder.ai> or <https://strategies.wayfinder.ai> (the "**Site**", "**Sites**") and any related developer tools we provide such as software development kits, libraries, sample code, documentation, or application programming interfaces (collectively, "**SDKs**" and "**APIs**") are collectively called the "**Services**." The user-facing interface(s) are referred to as the "Interface." Unless otherwise specified, references to the "Services" include the Interface and any SDKs/APIs. The Site enables access to a decentralized protocol that is designed to allow artificial intelligent agents to interact with one another through a permission-less blockchain-based network (the "**Protocol**") made available by Wayfinder Foundation (the "**Foundation**", "**we**", "**us**" or "**our**"). The Foundation does not own, control, manage or operate the Protocol, which is a community-driven, peer-to-peer set of blockchain-based smart contracts and tools that enable certain users ("**Users**") and artificial intelligent agents ( "**Agents**") to interact with the Protocol to create, move or otherwise interact with crypto-assets across multiple blockchains. To make these Terms easier to read, the Site and our services are collectively called the "Interface."

**THE EXPERIMENTAL USE OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IS AT YOUR OWN RISK**

Interacting with Agents via the Interface for transactions involving crypto-assets is highly experimental. Agents may exhibit unintended or unpredictable behavior ("Hallucinations") that could result in the loss of your crypto-assets or other unknown or unpredictable adverse consequences. In addition, Agents may perform actions that are not anticipated, or that deviate significantly and materially from instructions you have provided to the Agent. These Hallucinations could lead to unintended behavior that could result in loss of your crypto-assets or other harms that may not be apparent, anticipated, known, or predictable. Your use or interaction with the Agents via the Interface and the Protocol is highly experimental and acknowledge and accept all of the risks associated with such use, including but not limited to those risks described above.

**BEFORE ACCESSING THE INTERFACE OR ANY SERVICES YOU MUST READ, UNDERSTAND AND AGREE TO THE** [TERMS OF SERVICE](https://cache.wayfinder.ai/terms) **AND THE FOLLOWING DISCLAIMER. YOUR USE OF THE INTERFACE ENABLES ACCESS TO A SERIES OF SMART CONTRACTS AND RELATED SERVICES THAT ARE NOT CONTROLLED OR MANAGED BY US. BECAUSE THE SERVICES ARE HIGHLY EXPERIMENTAL, BY CONTINUING TO ACCESS THIS SITE OR THE INTERFACE, OR OTHERWISE ACCESS THE SMART CONTRACTS OR RELATED SERVICES, YOU AGREE TO THE FOLLOWING TERMS. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS YOU ARE PROHIBITED FROM ACCESSING THIS SITE, THE INTERFACE, ANY OF THE SMART CONTRACTS OR RELATED SERVICES.**

**Interaction this interface & crypto-assets WARNING**

By accessing the Interface or using any SDK/API (including any code that interacts with the Protocol or smart contracts), you have the ability to interact with crypto-assets and distributed ledger technology ("DLT") through a blockchain. The novel and largely untested nature of DLT means that the Protocol, or accompanying technologies or services, may not function as intended or at scale, and inherent flaws or limitations in the software underlying the Protocol or its design could manifest in ways that have not been identified or are understood. This could result in vulnerabilities to cyber-attacks, AI hallucinations, the irreversibility of transactions, susceptibility to fraud, software bugs, or other technical issues that could compromise the integrity, security, or reliability of the Protocol, the interface or any related services. When you use any of the services you acknowledge and agree that you will solely be responsible for your interactions with all crypto-assets that are directly or indirectly linked to this interface. Any access that the interface or this site provides are to smart contracts or blockchain protocols we do not control or manage, and are provided on an "as is" basis.. You are solely responsible for safeguarding your credentials, your private keys, any passwords or other authentication credentials. You agree to hold harmless and waive any and all claims against the Wayfinder Foundation for any and all claims that are directly or indirectly related to any harm you suffer, loss of funds, or any other damages that arise from or are related to any interaction with the interface or smart contracts deployed through the Wayfinder Protocol. Programmatic access via an SDK/API can increase the speed and frequency of transactions, and may amplify losses resulting from errors, bugs, incorrect parameters, compromised credentials, or unintended Agent behavior.

**14\. Governing Law and Forum Choice**

These Terms and any action related thereto will be governed by the laws of the Cayman Islands, without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. The parties expressly consent to personal and exclusive jurisdiction in the courts located in the Cayman Islands, and you and the Wayfinder Foundation each waive any objection to jurisdiction and venue in such courts.

**15\. Indemnity**

- **Mandatory Arbitration of Disputes**. We each agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof or the use of the Interface (collectively, "Disputes") will be resolved solely by binding, individual arbitration and not in a class, representative or consolidated action or proceeding. You and the Foundation agree that the Cayman Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of these Terms, and that you and the Foundation are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of these Terms.
- **Exceptions**. As limited exceptions to Section 15.a above: (i) we both may seek to resolve a Dispute in small claims court if it qualifies; and (ii) we each retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief from a court to prevent (or enjoin) the infringement or misappropriation of our intellectual property rights.
- **Conducting Arbitration and Arbitration Rules**. The arbitration will be conducted by JAMS under its JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures (the "JAMS Rules") then in effect, except as modified by these Terms. The JAMS Rules are available at <https://www.jamsadr.com/>. A party who wishes to start arbitration must submit a written Demand for Arbitration to JAMS and give notice to the other party as specified in the JAMS Rules. JAMS provides a form Demand for Arbitration at <https://www.jamsadr.com/>. Any arbitration hearings will take place San Francisco, California, but will be conducted remotely to the extent permitted by the JAMS Rules. The parties agree that the arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to decide all issues relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability and scope of this arbitration agreement.
- **Arbitration Costs**. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the JAMS Rules, and we won't seek to recover the administration and arbitrator fees we are responsible for paying, unless the arbitrator finds your Dispute frivolous. If we prevail in arbitration we'll pay all of our attorneys' fees and costs and won't seek to recover them from you. If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys' fees and expenses to the extent provided under applicable law.
- **Injunctive and Declaratory Relief**. Except as provided in Section 15.b above, the arbitrator shall determine all issues of liability on the merits of any claim asserted by either party and may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim. To the extent that you or we prevail on a claim and seek public injunctive relief (that is, injunctive relief that has the primary purpose and effect of prohibiting unlawful acts that threaten future injury to the public), the entitlement to and extent of such relief must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration. The parties agree that litigation of any issues of public injunctive relief shall be stayed pending the outcome of the merits of any individual claims in arbitration.
- **Class Action Waiver. YOU AND The Foundation AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.** Further, if the parties' Dispute is resolved through arbitration, the arbitrator may not consolidate another person's claims with your claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Dispute Resolution section shall be null and void.
- Severability. With the exception of any of the provisions in Section 15.f (Class Action Waiver), if an arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction decides that any part of these Terms is invalid or unenforceable, the other parts of these Terms will still apply.

**16\. General Terms**

- **Reservation of Rights**. The Foundation and its licensors exclusively own all right, title and interest in and to the Interface, including all associated intellectual property rights. You acknowledge that the Interface is protected by copyright, trademark, and other laws of the United States and foreign countries. You agree not to remove, alter or obscure any copyright, trademark, service mark or other proprietary rights notices incorporated by the Foundation.
- **Entire Agreement**. These Terms constitute the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between the Foundation and you regarding the Interface, and these Terms supersede and replace all prior oral or written understandings or agreements between the Foundation and you regarding the Interface. If any provision of these Terms is held invalid or unenforceable by an arbitrator or a court of competent jurisdiction, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the other provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect. You may not assign or transfer these Terms, by operation of law or otherwise, without the Foundation's prior written consent. Any attempt by you to assign or transfer these Terms, without such consent, will be null. The Foundation may freely assign or transfer these Terms without restriction. Subject to the foregoing, these Terms will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns.
- **Notices**. Any notices or other communications provided by the Foundation under these Terms will be given: (i) via email; or (ii) by posting to the Interface. For notices made by email, the date of receipt will be deemed the date on which such notice is transmitted.
- **Waiver of Rights**. The Foundation's failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of such right or provision. The waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of the Foundation. Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms or otherwise.

**17\. Malicious Actor Policy**

The Wayfinder Score system is designed to be resistant to malicious actors, bad behavior, and general abuse. There will always be edge cases that we have not predicted that will become obvious when we do a detailed analysis of accounts closer to TGE time. Deliberately abusing any feature of the Score or Modifier system will not be tolerated. Example: We have a high tolerance for referring wallets, even referring your own wallets, but expect users to be reasonable, responsible, and honest. There will be a clear common sense line between diversification of your assets and abuse. If you cross into whatever we deem "abuse" territory, you will be subject to forfeiture of all points related to the referral modifier, as well as other potential penalties. The wallet referral system is an easy example, but it is important for our users to know that we will take any attempts to abuse our system, and attempts to act in bad faith to increase your profits at the expense of others, very seriously. When it is time for TGE we will be following examples set down by projects that have recently set philosophical precedents with their own TGEs. Should there ever come a time when users have found a way to abuse the Score system, we will offer a chance to self-report pre-TGE, without added penalties. This post serves as a preemptive warning, not inspired by any current vulnerabilities, but out of the interest of transparency for our users. If you are acting in good faith, you need not be concerned. If you are acting in bad faith and are already attempting to circumvent or exploit our systems, you should be concerned. Deliberate abuse will not be tolerated and will possibly be subject to further punishment beyond forfeiture of ill-gotten rewards. We will not support the exploitation of the majority of our users for the benefit of the few.
